## Professional Summaries

### Bad Examples

> "Hardworking and passionate software developer looking for opportunities to grow and learn in a dynamic environment."

Problems: Generic, no specifics, sounds like everyone else, no proof of capability.

> "I am a full-stack developer with experience in JavaScript, Python, and various databases. I have worked on many projects and am a team player who communicates well."

Problems: Uses "I", vague ("many projects"), soft skill claims without evidence.

### Good Examples

> "Full-stack engineer with 6 years building scalable web applications. Led development of a payment platform processing $2M daily transactions. Expertise in React, Node.js, and AWS. Seeking senior roles at fintech companies focused on developer experience."

Why it works: Specific years, quantified achievement, named technologies, clear target.

> "Security engineer specializing in cloud infrastructure hardening. Reduced vulnerability count by 73% across 200+ microservices at Series B startup. AWS Security Specialty certified. Strong background in automated compliance tooling and DevSecOps practices."

Why it works: Specific specialty, dramatic metric, credential, concrete skills.

## Achievement Bullets

### Bad Examples

> "Responsible for managing the team and ensuring project completion."

Problems: Describes duty, not achievement. No outcome or metric.

> "Helped improve website performance."

Problems: Vague ("helped"), no specifics on what or how much.

> "Worked on various features for the mobile app."

Problems: "Worked on" is weak, "various" is meaningless, no impact stated.

### Good Examples

> "Led migration from monolith to microservices architecture, reducing deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes and enabling 10x release frequency."

Why it works: Specific action, before/after metrics, business impact clear.

> "Built real-time fraud detection system processing 50K transactions/second with 99.9% accuracy, preventing $3.2M in fraudulent charges monthly."

Why it works: Concrete deliverable, scale metrics, business value in dollars.

> "Mentored 4 junior engineers through promotion cycles while maintaining personal output of 40+ PRs monthly."

Why it works: Shows leadership and individual contribution simultaneously.

> "Reduced page load time from 8.3s to 1.2s by implementing lazy loading and CDN caching, improving conversion rate by 23%."

Why it works: Specific technical actions tied to business outcome.

- Developed new features
- Fixed bugs
- Attended meetings
- Worked with team members
- Used agile methodology

## Skills Sections

### Bad Example

```
Skills: JavaScript, Python, SQL, Communication, Problem Solving, Team Player,
Microsoft Office, Agile, Leadership, Quick Learner
```

Problems: No organization, mixes hard/soft skills randomly, includes generic soft skills and outdated items.

### Good Example

```
Languages: TypeScript (5 yrs), Python (4 yrs), Go (2 yrs), SQL
Frameworks: React, Node.js, FastAPI, Next.js
Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
Data: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Apache Kafka

```

Why it works: Categorized clearly, years for key skills, relevant technologies only, no soft skills that can't be verified.

## Project Descriptions

### Bad Example

> "Personal Project - Built a website using React and Node.js"

Problems: No link, generic description, doesn't show what it does or why it matters.

### Good Examples

> "[TaskFlow](https://github.com/user/taskflow) - Open-source Kanban board with real-time sync. Built with React, Socket.io, and PostgreSQL. 500+ GitHub stars, used by 3 dev teams at Fortune 500 companies."

Why it works: Linked, explains what it is, shows tech stack, proves traction.

> "[SecureScan CLI](https://github.com/user/securescan) - Dependency vulnerability scanner for Node.js projects. Featured in Node Weekly. 2K+ weekly npm downloads."

Why it works: Clear purpose, external validation (newsletter feature), usage metrics.

## Education Entries

### Bad Example

```
University of State
Computer Science
2015-2019
GPA: 3.1
```

Problems: Incomplete degree name, no context, mediocre GPA listed (should be omitted if below 3.5).

### Good Example (Recent Graduate)

```

AWS Solutions Architect Professional (2023) | Kubernetes Administrator (CKA, 2022)
```

Why it works: Condensed education, leads with relevant certifications.

## Common Transformations

When reviewing CVs, look for these patterns to improve:

| Weak Pattern | Strong Replacement |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "Responsible for..." | "[Action verb] + [specific task] + [result]" |
| "Helped with..." | "Contributed to... by specifically..." |
| "Worked on..." | "Built/Designed/Implemented..." |
| "Various projects" | "[Specific number] projects including..." |
| "Improved performance" | "Improved [metric] by [X%]" |
| "Large-scale system" | "System handling [X users/requests/data]" |
| "Team player" | "Collaborated with [X]-person team to..." |
| "Good communicator" | "Presented to [audience] on [topic]" |

## Metrics to Look For

Help users identify and include these types of metrics:

- **Scale**: Users, requests/second, data volume, team size
- **Speed**: Time saved, deployment frequency, response times
- **Quality**: Bug reduction, uptime percentage, accuracy rates
- **Money**: Revenue generated, costs reduced, budget managed
- **Growth**: User growth %, efficiency improvements, adoption rates
- **Impact**: People mentored, promotions enabled, processes changed

If the user says "I don't have metrics," probe with:
- "How many users did the feature serve?"
- "How much time did this save compared to before?"
- "What was the before/after comparison?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't done this?"
