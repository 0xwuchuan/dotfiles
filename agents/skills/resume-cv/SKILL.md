# Resume/CV Writing Skill

## Philosophy

**The real goal of a CV isn't to get you the job - it's to get you the conversation.**

Your CV has one job: convince a busy hiring manager in 6-10 seconds that you're worth a 30-minute call. Every word must earn its place.

## Core Principles

### 1. Impact Over Responsibilities
Never describe what the job was supposed to be. Show what you actually achieved.

- **Bad**: "Responsible for managing database systems"
- **Good**: "Reduced query latency by 73% through index optimization, saving $40K/month in infrastructure costs"

### 2. Metrics Over Vague Claims
Quantify everything possible. Numbers are proof.

- **Bad**: "Improved system performance significantly"
- **Good**: "Improved API response time from 2.3s to 180ms"

### 3. Action Verbs Over Weak Language
Start every bullet with a strong verb. Avoid "helped," "assisted," "worked on."

Strong verbs: Built, Led, Designed, Reduced, Increased, Migrated, Architected, Shipped, Launched, Automated

### 4. Tailored Over Generic
Every CV should be customized for the target role. Lead with what matters most for that specific job.

## Suggested Sections

Order these based on the user's background and target role (strongest selling points first):

1. **Header** - Name, target role, hyperlinked contacts
2. **Professional Summary** - 3-4 sentence elevator pitch
3. **Key Achievements** - Top 3-5 quantified wins
4. **Skills** - Categorized technical and domain expertise
5. **Work Experience** - Impact stories, not job descriptions
6. **Projects** - Open source, hackathons, side projects
7. **Education & Certifications** - Degrees and relevant certs
8. **Additional** - Publications, speaking, languages

See [sections-guide.md](./references/sections-guide.md) for detailed guidance on each section.

## Formatting Rules

- **Length**: 1 page for <10 years experience, 2 pages maximum
- **Font**: Modern, readable (Inter, Calibri, Helvetica) - never Times New Roman
- **Links**: All URLs must be clickable hyperlinks
- **No photos**: Unless explicitly required by region/industry
- **No personal details**: Age, marital status, nationality are not needed
- **Consistent formatting**: Same date format, bullet style, spacing throughout
- **PDF export**: Always deliver as PDF to preserve formatting

## Workflow

### When Reviewing an Existing CV

1. **Read the entire CV** first to understand the user's background
2. **Identify the target role** - ask if not clear
3. **Assess structure** - are sections in optimal order?
4. **Evaluate each bullet** against the CAR formula (Challenge, Action, Result)
5. **Look for missing metrics** - probe for numbers the user may have forgotten
6. **Check formatting** - links, consistency, length
7. **Provide specific rewrites** - don't just critique, show the improvement

### When Writing a New CV

1. **Gather information** through conversation:
   - Target role and industry
   - Years of experience
   - Key skills and technologies
   - 3-5 proudest achievements
   - Recent work history
   - Education and certifications
   - Notable projects or contributions

2. **Draft sections** in order of impact for their situation

3. **Iterate** based on feedback

### Probing for Metrics

Users often undersell themselves. Help them find metrics by asking:

- "How many users/customers did this affect?"
- "What was the before/after comparison?"
- "How much time/money did this save?"
- "What scale was this operating at?"
- "What would have happened without your work?"

## Common Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bullets start with "Responsible for" | Rewrite with action verb + outcome |
| No metrics anywhere | Probe for scale, time savings, improvements |
| Generic summary | Add years, specific skills, signature achievement |
| Skills list too long | Remove outdated/irrelevant, categorize |
| Work history reads like job description | Transform duties into achievements |
| Inconsistent formatting | Standardize dates, bullets, spacing |
| Too long | Cut oldest/least relevant items |
| No hyperlinks | Add mailto:, LinkedIn, GitHub, project links |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every bullet has a quantified result or clear impact
- [ ] Summary includes years of experience and a specific achievement
- [ ] Skills are categorized and relevant to target role
- [ ] All links are hyperlinked (not plain text URLs)
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Appropriate length (1-2 pages)
- [ ] Action verbs at the start of every bullet
- [ ] No first-person pronouns ("I", "my")
- [ ] Tailored to the specific target role
